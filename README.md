# 2017 University of New Brunswick Programming Competition
---
This repo is a compilation of the problems and solutions from the 2017
Programming Competition which took place at UNBSJ.</br>

Please note all coded solutions have been written in C, which is the language I chose to use. All solutions are not the most optimal solution, but they are the ones I was able to come up with while under a time constraint.</br> 

I may try to ameliorate my code in preperation for the 2018 Competition, if so I will keep the old code within the repo along with the newer and better solution. </br>
