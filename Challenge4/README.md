# Challenge Four: Where is UNBSJ?
---
This problem is just a simple game of word searches, with a single world to be found: UNBSJ.</br>

The input contains a character array, containing only upper-case letters (not separated by spaces). The dimensions of this array are proveided in the first line, as the number of rows followed by the number of columns (2 postive integers seperated by a space).</br>

The word UNBSJ is guaranteed to be in the array exactly once. It can be read only from left to right or from top to bottom. Your output should contain a single line, with 2 numbers sparated by a space. These numbers should represent the coordinates (row number followed by column number) of the 'U' in UNBSJ. It is assumed that the top-left corner of the array (the letter 'T' here) is at coordinates (1,1).</br>
